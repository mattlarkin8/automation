# **LAB - Class 19**

## **Project: Automation**

### Author: Matthew Larkin

### Setup

Activate your `venv` and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

Run the program with `python automation/automation.py`.

#### Tests

The program outputs email and phone data to `emails.txt` and `phone_numbers.txt` respectively.  
You can test the program by deleting these two files and then running it. The files should be recreated and contain the proper data.  
You could also import a different file to pull data from and modify the program to work with that file instead.  
Check that `emails.txt` and `phone_numbers.txt` contain the values from your new file.
